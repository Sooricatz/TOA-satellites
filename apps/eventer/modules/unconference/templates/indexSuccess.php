            	<h3>What to expect</h3>
            	<p>At this year’s unconference on Day 1 we want to take a critical view of what Technology has achieved over the last decades and whether the expectations we had when we were little kids watching Blade Runner were actually met.<br>
In some areas technology has clearly over-delivered, but in other areas it still falls short. Not that it should be considered a sign of ultimate human achievement, but isn’t it crazy that 20 years ago we were able to fly across the Atlantic in half the time. And why the hell do cars still use four wheels to get us from A to B.</p>

				<p>Dude, where is my Hover-board?</p>

				<p>It also seems that more and more people are beginning to question whether applied science will achieve its earlier promise that life would inevitably improve through technological progress. Many start to feel that the desired or expected future has failed to materialise and are increasingly keen on switching off and living off the grid.<br>
				Join us for a day where we'll get smart thinkers and doers together to look at both the alienating and empowering effects of technology.</p>

				<p>If you would like to highlight a specific angle of technology in a talk or would like to recommend someone, please get in touch with us.<break>
				We can't wait to see you at the unconference.</p>

				<p>And no worries, you’ll be able to park your hover-boards outside!</p>
