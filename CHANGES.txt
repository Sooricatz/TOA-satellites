  event view, user's own events view)
- Completely removed event deletion by user (as suggested)
- Added few sanity checks in event editing methods (checking if user is logged
  in)
- Added working image code for organisers (creating, editing, single event
  view)
- Added few good and bad flash messages (event saving, organiser saving)
- Some (sadly failish) coding around the time pagination
